## May 27th

I started working on this project on May 20th. I have been searching for examples and tools that might be useful, such as tricks and hosts for my website. I have completed the ideation of the website and the initial structure. The next step will be to design the components of the website. This will include a mockup and a simplified version of the website.

**Header**

The header should include the name, a brief description of the aspirations, and a navigation menu. The navigation menu should allow visitors to easily navigate to different sections of the website.

**Main**

The main section of the website should be divided into two parts:  path and best projects.

- **The path** should tell the story of journey as a creative professional. This might include information about education, work experience, and personal projects.
- **Best projects** should showcase most impressive work. Each project should include a brief description, high-quality images, and any relevant links.

**Footer**

The footer should include the contact information, such as email address and socia media.
